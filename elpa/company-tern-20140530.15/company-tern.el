;; Add `company-tern' to allowed `company-mode' backends list
;;
;;     (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-tern)
;;
;; If you don't like circles after object's own properties consider less
;; annoying marker for that purpose.
;;
;;     (setq company-tern-own-property-marker "")
;;
;; You can trim too long function signatures to the frame width.
;;
;;     (setq company-tern-meta-as-single-line t)
;;
;; If you doesn't like inline argument annotations appear with
;; corresponding identifiers, then you can to set up the company align
;; option.
